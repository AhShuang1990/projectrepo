What Is Git?
Distributed Version Control System (DVCS): Every developer has a full copy of the repository (including its history) on their local machine.

Created by Linus Torvalds (2005): Originally built to manage the Linux kernel’s source code, Git is now the de‑facto standard for version control in software development.

Snapshot‑Based Model: Rather than storing diffs, Git conceptually takes a “snapshot” of all your files at each commit.
